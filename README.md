## myCo: Submit Registry
There are 2 parts:

- Upload / download of files
- Blockchain registry


Personal data from registrant:
- Address (wallet)
- Email

Other information can be included too.


The upload / download of files are using RIF storage, from IOV Labs.

The files are saved at two decentralized storage systems:
- IPFS
- Swarm

In the future they will be in the same project. 

Doing the upload, automatically it will add the registry at Blockchain

Can be used with these Blockchains:
- Ethereum
- RSK

## myCo: Confirm Registry

In the future, can return registrant information, timestamp, blockchain proof addresses, and a url for the original file.


## myCo: Confirm Hash
